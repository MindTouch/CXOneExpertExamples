## Authorization Tokens

In order to interaction with our API as an approved session and/or as authenticated users, an [Authorization token](https://success.mindtouch.com/Integrations/API/Authorization_Tokens) must be used. 

### Server Tokens

Server API Tokens are used to create integrations between a server application, IoT, bots, or anything that can communicate over HTTPS, and the API. [Docs on usage](https://success.mindtouch.com/Integrations/API/Authorization_Tokens/Use_a_Server_API_Token_With_an_Integration#Node.js_Example)
